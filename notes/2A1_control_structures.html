<h3 id="asking-a-question">Asking a Question</h3>

<p>There comes a time when input from the user is required to be able to
collect data to process. This can be done using the input function. This
function takes a string prompt as an argument. When the code is run the
user sees the prompt and types in the data. input takes this data in as
a <strong>string</strong>, i.e. a piece of text. An example of using input follows.</p>
<div class="viz">

  <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"What is your name? "</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"! Have a nice day."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</div>

<p>Saving as <code class="highlighter-rouge">input.py</code> and running the code, the output is similar to</p>

<div class="viz">

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
What is your name? Arthur, King of the Britons
Hello Arthur, King of the Britons! Have a nice day.
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</div>
<p>Notice that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> prompt has a space at the end after the question mark. This space is included to separate the question from the user’s response in the interaction. Without it, the interaction would look less appealing to the user: 
	<code class="highlighter-rouge">What is your name?Arthur, King of the Britons</code></p>

<p>As the example shows, strings can be joined together to form one string for use in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> function. This is very useful in situations such as this where we want to print a combination of messages and values (as in our example). The examples show both methods of joining strings together for printing. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">,</code> is the first one used, it joins any items together with spaces automatically placed in between. The second is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> symbol, it joins the items together by adding one string to the next to form a single string.</p>

<p>In programing there is always a time when a test is required. This can be used, for example, to see if a number has a relationship with another or if two objects are the same.</p>

<p>There are several character combinations that allow for testing.</p>

<p>As can be seen these statements result in either True or False. True or False are the two possible values of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">bool</code> (short for boolean). Also note that upper and lower case letters in strings are not equal and that an upper case letter is less than the corresponding lower case letter. The reason for this is that computers can only understand numbers and not any characters. Therefore, there is a convention set up to map every character to a number. This convention has become the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ASCII</code> scheme. ASCII makes the upper case letters be the numbers 65 through to 90 and the lower case letters the numbers 97 to 122.</p>

<h3 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h3>
<p>The ability to do a test has no use if it can not be used in a program. It is possible to test and execute a body of code if the test evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>.</p>

<p>This is done using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example. The following code is an example of an if statement that will display a hello message if the name input by the user is <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Tim"</code>.</p>
<div class="viz">

  <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"What is your name? "</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <p>If test evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code> then <em>body</em> is executed. Otherwise, <em>body</em> is skipped.</p>

If test evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code> then <em>body1</em> is executed. Otherwise <em>body2</em> is executed.</p>

</div>

<p>It is also possible to carry out multiple tests within the same if statement and execute different blocks of code depending on which test evaluates to True. We can do this simply by using an <strong>if, elif, else</strong> statement.
Our example can be modified further to look like the following</p>

<div class="viz">

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>name = input("What is your name? ")

<h3 id="being-repetitive">Being Repetitive</h3>
<p>We are off to a good start, but the interaction is not very long. We are not doing much before we abruptly end the conversation. For our next addition to the program, we would like to be able to talk to the user for as long as we can. Let’s accomplish this by asking the user for a topic, talking about that topic, then asking for another topic. Here is an example of what we might want:</p>
<div class="viz">

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What is your name? Tim
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter
What do you want to talk about? Python
Do you like Python? yes
Why do you think that? it's easy to use
I also think that it's easy to use
What do you want to talk about? coconuts
Do you like coconuts? no
Why do you think that? they cannot migrate
I also think that they cannot migrate
What do you want to talk about? CSSE1001
Do you like CSSE1001? very much
Why do you think that? the course notes are very useful
I also think that the course notes are very useful
What do you want to talk about? nothing
Okay. Goodbye, Tim!
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</div>

<p>To do this, we will need to have a way to repeat the discussion until the conversation is over. We can use a construct called a <strong>while</strong> loop. We need to consider what code should be repeated (in this case, the discussion of a topic) and when it should keep going (in this case, when the topic is not “nothing”). Let’s update our code to include the repetition. This code can be downloaded as <code class="highlighter-rouge">interaction_while.py</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">topic = input(...)</code> line above the loop asks for the first topic. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">while topic != "nothing"</code> line checks if the given condition is <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>, and if it is, then the loop body repeatedly performs the actions until the condition is <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code>. Notice that the last line of the body asks for a new topic, which is used as the topic for the next repetition of the loop. If that new topic is <code class="highlighter-rouge">nothing</code>, then the loop test <code class="highlighter-rouge">topic != "nothing"</code> becomes <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code>, so the while loop will stop running and the code will continue after the loop body (where the indentation stops).
Notice that we are asking if the user likes the topic, but we are not using the response that the user gives. Ignoring the input from the user is very unusual behaviour, but we have done it here to simplify the example.
Run this code to experiment with it. What happens when the first topic is “nothing”? Why does that happen?
One thing that might seem a bit odd about our code is that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">topic = input(...)</code> line occurs in two places, once before the while loop, and once at the end of the loop body. This has to happen this way because the topic needs to be entered in before the <code class="highlighter-rouge">topic != "nothing"</code> test happens. We can avoid this by exiting the loop from inside the body. This is done using the <strong>break</strong> keyword. When <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> is executed inside a loop, the program will immediately exit the loop and continue after the body. We can use this with an if statement to specify how the loop should finish. This code is available at <code class="highlighter-rouge">interaction_break.py</code></p>

<p>The first change that we have made is the condition test of the while loop. Since the loop keeps going as long as the condition is <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>, that means that “<code class="highlighter-rouge">while True</code>” will keep going until the <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> is reached (or it will go on forever if there is no <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code>; loops that go forever are called <em>infinite loops</em>). Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> in this way means that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">topic = input(...)</code> line only has to appear once in our code.
In many situations, it is considered bad programming practice to have logic that exits a loop from within the middle of the loop body. This is because it complicates understanding the loop’s behaviour. The reader needs to understand the loop’s logical condition plus find and understand the break logic in the middle of the loop body. In the example above, the loop body is short and simple enough that finding the break logic is not difficult. However, once the logic becomes more complex and the code longer it would be harder to read. Try to avoid writing code that exits a loop from the middle of the loop’s body. But, be aware that it is possible and you may need to identify this type of logic in someone else’s code.</p>

  <p>The first line contains the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> followed by a boolean <code class="highlighter-rouge">test</code> and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>. Following is the body, an indented block of code.</p>
  <h4 id="semantics-2">Semantics</h4>
  <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">test</code> evaluates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code> then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> is executed. Then the test is evaluated again, if it is still <code class="highlighter-rouge">True</code>, then the body is executed again. This process repeats until the test fails (becomes <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code>). Each repetition is called an <strong>iteration</strong> through the loop, and the act of performing a repeated task is called <strong>iterating</strong>. When the test becomes <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code> (or if it is <code class="highlighter-rouge">False</code> to start with), we “exit the loop” and execute the next statement after the indented block.
If a <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> statement is executed inside the loop, the loop will exit immediately.</p>
