#### Aside

Further information will appear in these boxes. These asides go beyond the course content, but you may find them interesting. You can safely ignore them, but they will often demonstrate several powerful features of Python, and they may be a useful challenge for some students.

#### Visualizations

These boxes contain visualizations of Python code. You might find that these visualizations aid in your understanding of how Python works. You can visualize your own code by going to the Python Tutor Visualisation Tool at [http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html).
