### What is Software Engineering?

**Software Engineering** is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software (<cite>IEEE std 610.12-1990</cite>). A software engineer must have a good understanding of tools and techniques for requirements gathering, specification, design, implementation, testing and maintenance.

These days, software systems are often very large and many contain key safety or mission-critical components. The complexity of modern software systems require the application of good software engineering principles. Indeed, many agencies mandate the use of particular tools and techniques to achieve very high quality and reliable software.

This course introduces some of the key principles of software engineering and gives you the chance to put them into practice by using the programming language Python. While you'll learn lots of Python in this course, it is equally important that you learn some common programming principles and techniques so that learning the next language is not as daunting.

#### What is Python?

Python is a powerful, yet simple to use high-level programming language. Python was designed and written by Guido van Rossum and named in honour of Monty Python's Flying Circus. The idea being that programming in Python should be fun! The quotes in these notes all come from Monty Python and it has become somewhat of a tradition to reference Monty Python when writing Python tutorials.

#### What is Software?

Software (a computer program) is a set of instructions that tell the computer (hardware) what to do. All computer programs are written in some kind of **programming language**, which allows us to precisely tell the computer what we want to do with it.
