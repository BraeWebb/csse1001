### Writing Software

Software is often written by using a program called an **Integrated Development Environment**, or **IDE**. An IDE typically consists of an editor (often with syntax highlighting and layout support), a compiler or interpreter, class or library browsers and other tools to aid in software development and maintenance.

In this course we will be using **IDLE**, which is an IDE for Python.

When IDLE is started it will look something like this.

The window shown contains the running interpreter. The `>>>` is the interpreter prompt - the interpreter is waiting for user input. **Note:** This image is taken from Windows 7 and will appear different depending on the Operating System you are using.

Below is a simple example of an interaction with the interpreter - note the syntax highlighting used by IDLE. The user inputs an expression at the prompt (followed by pressing Enter) and the interpreter responds by printing the result and another prompt.

```python
	print("Hello World")
    >>> 2 + 3
```

#### Exercise

Make sure Python and IDLE are installed on your machine. In this course we use the latest version of Python (version 3.x). To see how to install python on your own computer see [Installing Python](/installing-python). Then start up IDLE and try the above examples.

In the remainder of these notes we will use different boxes to indicate different parts of the content. Below are examples.
